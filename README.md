# HodgePodge
 Big world, many systems, all interwoven

Okay so the idea for Hodgepodge was to make a big world, made out of a bunch of interlocking systems, heavily inspired by the amazing Crypt Underworld by Lilith Zone on itch.io.

The idea I went with when starting development was a kind of topdown platformer focused on multi-use abilities. Pits everywhere that'd you have to use your abilities to cross, by completing velocity puzzles in mid-air. Would've been a whole lot better in 3d I'm sure but I don't have the patience to figure that out right now. I prefer development over learning.

So far this version has a couple of things.
- A basic level showing off the speedgate puzzles I was working on (currently broken)
- A basic enemy (the stupidhead, an enemy that jumps at you)
- 2 basic abilities (the roll and the machine gun)
- Several level things (3 kinds of speedgates(broken), 1 kind of door, pots, and bounce pads)
- 2 drop types (Keys and Gems)
- A cute player character guy
